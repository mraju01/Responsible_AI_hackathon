# Responsible_AI_hackathon

The project we have come up with is to categorize extracted tweets into 6 unique categories namely: religion, age, gender, ethnicity, not_cyberbullying, other_cyberbullying. For this we have used Python programming language, with relevant Python libraries. Please install the required Python libraries using the command pip install -r requirements.txt

Once installed the required Python libraries run the cells sequentially to see the data preprocessing, modeling and results.
